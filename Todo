code for non parallel positions of ball in x y and z directions
- dd - unity simulation - 3 videos export with their coordinates and distance from camera for each time interval - 0.01 s 
1st video for parallel to image plane 
2nd video for non parallel 60 d as initial angle 
3rd video for non parallel 45 d as initial angle 
all for same speed
