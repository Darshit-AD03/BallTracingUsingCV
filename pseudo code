Define Video Capture
if video not Passed:
    start Camera

Input: Frame at which projectile starts


Loop through Frames(Video/Camera):

    If Frame not Found:
        break

    Define FPS

    resize Frame

    Make Frame Blurred

    convert to HSV

    Apply more filters to make detection easier

    Find Green Circles

    Record the coordinates of circle in each frame

    calculate diameter of ball

    calculate horizontal pixel distance between initial and final position of ball

    actual distance = (Actual Diameter/Pixel diameter of ball)*Pixel Distance







time of projectile = Frames between start and end of projectile/FPS

// Now we got Range of Projectile and Time
// so we can find initial angle of projectile and initial velocity of projectile and define the equation of projectile based on that
// Refer Mathematical Equations Derived from general equation of projectile





Loop through equation of Projectile and Plot X / Y component of Projectile
